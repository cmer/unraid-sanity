# Sanity Theme for Unraid 6.6+

This theme is based on Dynamic White. I modified it to be more to my liking. I hope it is to yours too!

## Installation

- Copy all `.css` files to `/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/dynamix/styles`
- Navigate to `http://your-unraid-ip/Settings/DisplaySettings` and select Sanity as your Dynamix Color Theme.

## Look and feel
