# Sanity Theme for Unraid 6.8+ and Theme Engine

This theme is based on Dynamix White. I modified it to be more to my liking. I hope you like it too.

## What's been done

- Uses your system default font (ie: San Francisco, Segoe, Roboto, etc)
- Buttons are colored and easier to identify
- Top menu looks like familiar tabs
- Reduced overall size of fonts and some elements

## Important note about old versions of this theme

The old versions of this theme (< 2.0) are no longer supported. Instead, this theme has been rewritten to make use of Theme Engine, a plugin that makes developing custom themes a little bit easier. If you are upgrading from an old version, simply follow the installation instructions below.

## Installation

- Install [Theme Engine](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/87126-plugin-theme-engine-a-webgui-styler/)
- SSH into your Unraid server and run the following command: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmer/unraid-sanity/master/install.sh | bash`

> :warning: **WARNING:** make sure to review the content of `install.sh` before curl-bashing!

- Visit the Theme Engine settings page and load the `Sanity-White` or `Sanity-Black` theme.

## Updates

- Updates have to be installed manually. Just run the shell command above.
