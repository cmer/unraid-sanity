# Sanity Theme for Unraid 6.6+

This theme is based on Dynamix White. I modified it to be more to my liking. I hope it is to yours too!

## What's been done

- Uses your system default font (ie: San Francisco, Segoe, Roboto, etc)
- Buttons are colored and easier to identify
- Top menu looks like familiar tabs
- Reduced overall size of fonts and some elements

## Installation

- SSH into your Unraid server
- Run `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmer/unraid-sanity/master/install.sh | sudo bash`
- Navigate to `http://your-unraid-ip/Settings/DisplaySettings` and select White as your Dynamix Color Theme.

## Look and feel
